# AI Flappy Bird

## Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic game Flappy Bird, with the added feature of implementing an artificial intelligence (AI) to play the game autonomously. The AI is trained using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, which evolves neural networks to learn how to play the game effectively.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulRahmanGit/AI-Based-Flappy-Bird.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AI-Based-Flappy-Bird
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the game:
   ```
   python flappy.py
   ```
2. Watch as the AI learns to play Flappy Bird autonomously.

## Configuration
You can modify various parameters and settings in the `config-feedforward.txt` file to adjust the behavior and performance of the AI.
